Please don't release anyone's work and say it's your own.


TODO:

I. Fix bow drawing animation (texture array?)

II. make recipe for shells not use an entire pearling knife, but only cause damage to knife.

III. figure out why the shell bra texture shows as the pearl chestplate instead. (texture points to shell_1, not pearl_1)
    (I even filled in the rest of the texture file with other armor types instead of transparency... Also created a shell_2
    file for "ghost" leggings. Still the shell bra takes on the Pearl Chestplate texture. I might just scrap it if I can't
    get the texture to work.)

IV. Add ability to repair using pearls in an anvil. Repair using same item (to retain enchantments) works, but I would like
    to add a less expensive recipe

Later TODO:

V. Make block that extends clay. Make it drop 3 clay (the item) and one oyster.
      OR
   Make a new entity "Oyster" that drops the item "oyster" when broken.

Maybe Never TODO(Maybe after everything above is done):

VI. Add Underwater Cities and Floating Fishing Villages to WorldGen.
